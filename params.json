While Spritz has an important scientific background, but it also has some basic characteristics that are annoying for most of readers:\r\n\r\n* They are inserted somewhere in the middle of the webpage. This encourages the readers to lose their attention.\r\n* They have a white background, black text and a red letter. The high level of contrast between this colors is the main reason for the feeling of eye fatigue.\r\n* The font is not good for reading\r\n* The font size is too big.\r\n\r\nSpeedReadingJS fixes this problems with simple solutions.\r\n\r\n* SpeedReadingJS appears on a lightbox. So, all elements of the webpage remain hidden to the reader while he reads.\r\n* The color combination is low contrast, with a dark background, a grey text and an ocher yellow letter to fix the eyes.\r\n* The font is Open Sans, one the clearest fonts of the web.\r\n* The font has a size smaller than Spritz, allowing a better eye fixation without losing the understanding of the word.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nSpeedReadingJS depends only on jQuery. Link *jQuery* and the *speedreading.js* file and SpeedReadingJS will be ready to use:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<script src='js/jquery.js'></script>\r\n<script src='js/speedreading.js'></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo start reading, just call the javascript speedreading.read('some text') function:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<script>\r\n  speedreading.read('Add speed reading functionality\r\n    to your website. SpeedReadingJS depends only on jQuery.\r\n    Link jQuery and the speedreading.js file and SpeedReadingJS\r\n    will be ready to use it.');\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Options\r\n\r\nYou can customize some properties of the speedreading object:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  // Set the position (in percentaje of the word) where\r\n  // eyes will focus their attention\r\n  speedreading.position = 0.260; \r\n\r\n  // Set the lag time of punctuation dots.\r\n  speedreading.dottime = 800;\r\n  \r\n  // Set the lag time of punctuation commas.\r\n  speedreading.commatime = 300;\r\n\r\n  // Set the average time in milliseconds between words.\r\n  // The time that long and short words will\r\n  // remain visible is a factor of this number.\r\n  speedreading.defaulttime = 180;\r\n\r\n  // Set a default text for speedreading.read() with no parameters\r\n  speedreading.text = 'This is a default text';\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
